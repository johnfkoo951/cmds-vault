### Quick Decision Tree

```
Are you trying to...
├─ Understand the system? → CMDS.md (you are here)
├─ Write code (Claude Code)? → CLAUDE.md
├─ Write code (Other AI)? → AGENTS.md
├─ Navigate to a category? → 🏛 CMDS Head Quarter.md
└─ Check standards/templates? → 🏛 CMDS Guide.md
```

**This file provides the "story" behind the system. For technical "how-to", see CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md.**

## Working Environments & Sync

This vault is synced across two Macs via **Obsidian Sync** (official Obsidian cloud server).

| 환경 | 기기 | Base Path |
|------|------|-----------|
| Primary | MacBook Pro (16-inch) | `/Users/yohankoo/Local Obsidian_MBP/CMDSPACE_Local_MBP` |
| Secondary | Mac Studio | `/Users/yohankoo/Obsidian_Local/CMDSPACE_Studio_Local_Org` |

- All subfolders and files are kept identical across both machines
- AI coding agent outputs are separated by environment subfolders under `00. Inbox/03. AI Agent/`:
	- `03-1. Claude Code (MBP)` / `03-2. Claude Code (Studio)` — Claude Code
	- `03-3. OpenClaw (MBP)` / `03-4. OpenClaw (Studio)` — OpenClaw

### Public Deployment of System Files
The 5 core system files (plus 7 shared rules) are published at **https://system.cmdspace.work** so that LLM agents and human collaborators can reference them without vault access.

- **Hosting**: Vercel project `cmds-system-files-v2` (team `johnfkoo951's projects`)
- **DNS**: Cloudflare (`cmdspace.work`) — A record `system → 76.76.21.21`
- **Deploy source**: `/Users/yohankoo/DEV/cmds-system-files/` (manual `vercel deploy --prod`)
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/johnfkoo951/cmds-system-files (code backup, not auto-deployed)
- For technical deploy flow, see [[CLAUDE.md]] → "📦 System Files Deployment" section

## What is CMDS?

**CMDS (커맨드스페이스)** is a comprehensive Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system built on Obsidian, designed to transform raw information into actionable knowledge and creative outputs. It's not just a filing system—it's a living ecosystem where ideas connect, merge, develop, and share.

### Core Philosophy

1. **Knowledge as a Network**: Every note is a node in an interconnected web of knowledge
2. **Process-Driven**: Knowledge flows through distinct stages (Connect → Merge → Develop → Share)
3. **AI-Enhanced**: Integrated with multiple AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney, etc.)
4. **Output-Focused**: Knowledge exists to be transformed into tangible outputs (research, lectures, consulting, creative works)
5. **Personal yet Structured**: Flexible enough for creativity, structured enough for productivity

- Think about potential publications ([[📚 821 Academic Journals]])

### Teaching Context
If discussing courses or lectures:
- Reference curriculum designs ([[📚 841 Curriculum]])
- Link to relevant subject expertise ([[📖 600 Specialties]])
- Consider student learning outcomes
- Think about course materials ([[📚 842 Course Development and Resources]])

### Consulting Context
If discussing client work:
- Document in meetings ([[60. Collections/63. Meetings/]])
- Connect to relevant expertise ([[📚 831 Consulting]])
- Reference applicable frameworks ([[📖 200 Literature]])
- Consider deliverables ([[📚 830 Projects]])

### Content Creation Context
If creating content:
- Identify target platform ([[📚 701 YouTube]], [[📚 802 Articles]], etc.)
- Reference source knowledge ([[📖 200 Literature]], [[📖 600 Specialties]])
- Use prompt templates ([[📚 492 Prompts]])
- Consider audience and purpose

### Knowledge Management Context
If discussing PKM system itself:
- Reference [[🏛 CMDS Guide]] for standards

## Working with the CMDS System

### When Creating New Notes
1. Determine the **CMDS category** (100-900 series) based on content type
2. Use appropriate **note type** (note, meeting, curriculum, etc.)
3. Add required **properties** (type, aliases, author, date created, tags)
4. Link to relevant **index notes** (🏷)
5. Reference related **CMDS categories**
6. Create **backlinks** to related notes

### When Organizing Information
- **Connect Stage** → Capture in [[📖 100 Themes]]
- **Merge Stage** → Integrate into [[📖 200 Literature]]
- **Develop Stage** → Apply in [[📖 300 Data]] through [[📖 600 Specialties]]
- **Share Stage** → Output via [[📖 700 Creatives]] or [[📖 800 Outputs]]

### Command Suite: CMDS Process as Operational Verbs (2026-04-14+)

The CMDS Process is no longer just a filing framework — it's now the **operational vocabulary** of the vault via 8 slash commands. Each stage has a matching command that encodes the full workflow (purpose gate, cross-vault search, back-link, frontmatter compliance):

| CMDS Process Stage | Command | What it does |
|-------------------|---------|--------------|
| 🔗 **Connect** | `/connect` | Capture inbox items into `📖 100 Themes` as stubs. Auto-classifies type (interest/topic/variable/terminology). Low-friction, fast. |
| 🔀 **Merge** | `/merge` | Synthesize N notes into 1 `📖 200 Literature` note. Multi-dialog: purpose → candidates → angle → draft review. The heaviest command. |
| 🛠 **Develop** | `/develop` | Apply methodology, build artifact (code, prompt, curriculum, specialty). Outputs to `00. Inbox/03. AI Agent/` first. |
| 📤 **Share** | `/share` | Orchestrate existing skills (`thebetter-writer`, `markdown-slides`, etc.) to produce 700-800 outputs. |

Plus cross-cutting utilities:

| Utility | Role |
|---------|------|
| `/inbox` | Scan inbox subfolders, route to the right stage command (read-only, uses `AskUserQuestion`) |
| `/lint {scope}` | Health check by stage (orphans, contradictions, stale, frontmatter v2 coverage) |
| `/query` | Search vault + LLM Wiki, synthesize answer. Results file back into appropriate CMDS category (not a separate folder) |
| `/status` | One-screen stage snapshot + recommended next action |

**Why this matters philosophically**: The CMDS Process was originally a conceptual framework for how knowledge moves through the vault. With commands, it becomes an **interactive cognitive scaffold** — asking "이걸 connect할까, merge할까?" is now the first metacognitive step of any session, which sharpens what the current work actually is. Commands are not just automation; they're thinking aids that make the CMDS Process tangible.

**Typical session patterns**:
- **Daily**: `/status` → `/inbox` → (`/connect` or `/merge`)
- **Weekly**: `/lint inbox` → `/merge {topic}` → `/share` (if applicable)
- **Project work**: `/query {topic}` → `/merge {topic}` → `/develop` or `/share`

> For command implementation details (parameters, dialog flows, output paths), see [[CLAUDE.md]] "CMDS Process Command Suite (2026-04-14+)" section. Command source files live in `90. Settings/94. Agent Settings/claude/commands/`.

### When Searching for Context
Look for relevant notes in:
1. **Index pages** (🏷) — Aggregated collections
2. **Hub pages** (🏛) — Main navigation
3. **CMDS categories** (📖, 📚) — Topical organization
4. **Daily/Weekly notes** — Temporal context
5. **Meeting notes** — Project context
6. **People notes** — Relationship context

## Guiding Principles

1. **Every note has a home**: All knowledge belongs somewhere in the 100-900 system
2. **Links create value**: Isolated notes are less useful than connected notes
3. **Process matters**: Knowledge flows through Connect → Merge → Develop → Share
4. **Output is the goal**: Knowledge exists to serve others through outputs
5. **AI is a partner**: AI tools enhance but don't replace human thinking
6. **Standards enable freedom**: Consistent structure allows creative flexibility
7. **Evolution over perfection**: The system grows and adapts continuously
